Gas sensor MQ7 detects the presence of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in the air. The best results are given when alcohol is in liquid form, however, it still does an amazing job when measuring in gas form. It needs a bit of time to warm up in order to work correctly.




The breakout board works with both digital (DO) and analog signals (AO). The digital output is obtained by setting a threshold value with a potentiometer. The analog output will differ depending on the intensity of the gas.
